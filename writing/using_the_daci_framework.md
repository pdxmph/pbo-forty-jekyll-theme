As companies grow and mature, it's often a challenge to understand who is responsible for what. In early stages, certain roles and responsibilities can live in one function or team, then migrate to new ownership as the company grows. As these changes occur, roles and responsibilities can become muddled or unclear, and it's not uncommon for a group of people embarking on a new project to become confused about "who owns what."

Further, as companies shift to  hybrid-remote models, it becomes more and more important to develop practices that work well for people who work somewhat asynchronously. That includes writing things down and creating written records of decisions. 

Decision-making frameworks can help clarify roles and responsibilities and chip away at the need for synchronous meetings by encouraging you to ask a few questions when you're designing a project, planning work, or making a decision:

- Who is responsible for making sure this work is happening?
- Who authorized this work and is responsible for approving it?
- Who is expected to weigh in or contribute to the project?
- Who needs to know about this work?

There's a large number of decision-making frameworks out there. Most people familiar with the topic are familiar with the [RACI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) model, which has been used around more mature organizations for some time. Personally, I prefer the [DACI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix#DACI)model to record roles and responsibilities for any work that requires more than one team or department. DACI's roles (driver, approver, contributor, informed) are a little more intuitive than RACI's (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) in practice, and more reflective of the shared ownership of a leadership team. 

## What is DACI?

DACI stands for "Driver, Approver, Contributors, Informed" and is used to describe the roles of people involved in a project, decision, or task. Here's each role in a little more detail:

- **Driver:** A single driver of the overall project: the person steering the car. The Driver develops the DACI for the project, identifies the high-level work that needs to be done, and leads the project throughout its lifecycle.
- **Approver(s):** One or more people who make most project decisions, and are responsible if it fails.
- **Contributors:** The people responsible for deliverables; and with whom there is two-way communication. Some people also refer to this part of the DACI matrix as "consulted" to account for people who should probably be asked to weigh in even if they aren't delivering anything besides advice or context.
- **Informed:** The people who are impacted by the project and are provided status and informed of decisions; and with whom there is one-way communication.

## How do you use DACI?
It's a good practice to put a DACI at the top of any project document you're starting and talk it through with people when you hold a kickoff meeting. It doesn't have to have fancy table formatting, it just needs to make clear who is performing each role in the project.

For complex projects with a number of workstreams, you may need to create a high-level DACI for the entire project, then DACIs for each workstream.

It's not out of line for the "Approver" in a DACI to be a group (e.g. a senior leadership team), in which case the "Driver" is accountable for wrangling consent and finalization from everyone in the "Approver" role. This isn't an invitation to descend into consensus culture or require unanimity to make a decision: Sometimes people have to make the choice to "disagree and commit." The Driver has the privilege of determining when productive conversation is exhausted and the work is ready for review by the Approver.

It's a best practice for the person in the Driver role to make the DACI available for review and comment:  

While the Driver is the ultimate decider of roles and responsibilities, asking for comment and feedback can help settle the sometimes tricky question of who's consulted and who's informed by giving stakeholders a chance to think about and comment on how they're impacted by a project. 

If you're doing something with broad implications for an entire organization or multiple departments/teams, asking the Approver for a quick review of the DACI before sharing widely is a good idea. They may have context about other departments or stakeholders that can help you craft a better, more inclusive DACI.
